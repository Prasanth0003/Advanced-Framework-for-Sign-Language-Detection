# Advanced-Framework-for-Sign-Language-Detection

### ABSTRACT

This project presents an advanced framework for Sign Language Detection leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system integrates OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time detection and tracking of hand, face, and pose landmarks, extracting key features crucial for gesture interpretation. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model is employed to recognize temporal patterns in gesture sequences. The dataset is structured into labeled action sequences, preprocessed, and used to train the model to achieve high accuracy in real-time predictions. The solution supports live video streams, enabling gesture-to-text translation with visual overlays for interpretability. This framework offers a robust and scalable approach for enhancing communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. 
### INTRODUCTION
##### 1.1 OVERVIEW
                           Sign language serves as a crucial mode of communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. However, the barrier between sign language users and non-sign language users often creates challenges in effective communication. To address this, advanced frameworks for sign language detection aim to bridge this gap by leveraging cutting-edge technologies in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing. These frameworks focus on accurately interpreting gestures, facial expressions, and hand movements, converting them into meaningful text or speech.

##### 1.2	 PURPOSE

               The purpose of this project is to develop an innovative and efficient framework for detecting and translating sign language into spoken or written forms, thereby fostering inclusivity and accessibility. By employing state-of-the-art machine learning models and real-time data processing, this system is designed to enhance communication between sign language users and the wider community. The framework also aims to provide a robust platform for researchers and developers to further expand the capabilities of sign language detection, ultimately empowering individuals with hearing or speech impairments
