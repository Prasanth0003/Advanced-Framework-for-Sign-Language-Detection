# Advanced-Framework-for-Sign-Language-Detection

### ABSTRACT

This project presents an advanced framework for Sign Language Detection leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system integrates OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time detection and tracking of hand, face, and pose landmarks, extracting key features crucial for gesture interpretation. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model is employed to recognize temporal patterns in gesture sequences. The dataset is structured into labeled action sequences, preprocessed, and used to train the model to achieve high accuracy in real-time predictions. The solution supports live video streams, enabling gesture-to-text translation with visual overlays for interpretability. This framework offers a robust and scalable approach for enhancing communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
